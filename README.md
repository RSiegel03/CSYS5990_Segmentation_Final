# There are 3 Models that have been trained and designed in this project.
The logistic regression model is stored in the logistic regression directory and the Unet and RL wrapper around the Unet are contained in the Unet_RLA directory.
Each directory has its own README.md file with instructions on how to reproduce results and install/use code. 

Data has not been supplied due to proprietary research being conducted with the data and due to size limitations with GitHub and its LFS.
